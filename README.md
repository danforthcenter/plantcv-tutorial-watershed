# Watershed Segmentation Tutorial

This tutorial uses the analyze watershed segmentation function to roughly segment individual leaves.
In this case, the number of objects reported from the analyze watershed function is a rough estimation
of the number of leaves. The Watershed Segmentation Function is a PlantCV function based on code contributed by Suxing Liu, Arkansas State University.
