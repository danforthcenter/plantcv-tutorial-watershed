# Watershed Segmentation Tutorial

Check out our interactive tutorial!  uses the analyze watershed segmentation function to roughly segment individual leaves.
In this case, the number of objects reported from the analyze watershed function is a rough estimation
of the number of leaves. The Watershed Segmentation Function is a PlantCV function based on code contributed by Suxing Liu, Arkansas State University.
